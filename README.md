# Soundex_Algorithm-EN-
This is an algorithm to find the soundex code of a word and then match it with it's homophones(i.e words with same soundex code)


Description:
This repository includes a Driver Function and Two Text files.

The Driver function(Soundex_driver.cpp) does the following thing:
           #It reads from the text file named as "readtxt.txt".
           #It convert each word into their soundex codes.
           #it writes the words and the soundex code as a pair in another file named as "Lexicon.txt".
           #It asks the user to give an input(string).
           #It converts the input into it's soundex code and compares it with the codes from the lexicon
           #Upon finding the same soundex code it displays the word it is paired with as a alternative to user's input
           
           
Note:      
#Please Note that it takes 6-7 mins or less to initialise the lexicon which it does every time it runs.
#PLease Note that any input other than alphabets is considered invalid.
#Please Note that only a single word could be checked in one instance rather a line.



What to ADD:
We could make use of other algorithms such as edit distance and such to determine most probable alternatives to our query and thus decreasing 
the number of suggestions that are displayed per query and also make more accurate.
We could make a function to update the lexicon rather than reinitialising every time also it could be made optional.
We could try to make the programme work for a string (group of words containg any charachters).
